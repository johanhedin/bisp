The scripts here allow you to automatically download a BankID tar archive for
Linux and then build a Fedora/CentOS RPM that can easily be installed with all
dependencies taken care of.

The RPM:s are i686 but work equally well on x86\_64. To be able to use
the Firefox pluing on x86\_64 you need to install nspluginwrapper.
