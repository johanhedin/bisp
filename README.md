The scripts here allow you to automatically download a BankID tar archive for
linux and then build a Fedora/CentOS RPM that can be easily insalled with all
dependencies take care of.

The RPM:s build are i686 but work equally well on x86\_64. To be able to use
the Firefox pluing on x86\_64 you need to install nspluginwrapper.
